=Synaptic Spiking Interface Project=

= Introduction =

Synaptic spiking is how biological systems communicate.  Millions of years of evolution have created this system of communication.  Understanding it is to understand engineering perfection.


= Overview of Electronic Interface for Reading Synaptic Spikes =

  # Signal goes into the pins
  #Signal is initially amplified by the Instrumentation amp 5x)
  # Signal is then amplified again by another op amp
  # Signal is then put through filters (filtering is needed to reduce noise, fluorescent lights for example)
  # Signal is then amplified a third time by another op amp
  # Signal is then fed to an audio out that sends +- 1 volt to represent the spikes

If the audio out jack is put into a computer the raw audio out can be converted from analog to a digital wav file!  From this wave file synaptic spikes can be studied.
