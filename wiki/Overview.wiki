An initial set of code is up for you to play with. It includes Python code to run in the [http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/ Android Scripting Environment], as well as code to run on your Arduino. See [http://www.instructables.com/id/Android-G1-Serial-To-Arduino/ this Instructable] for getting your Android phone connected to the Arduino physically over serial.

The ability to point the robot at a compass heading is still in progress, as is the GPS locating and audio recording. The other functions should be working for you.
